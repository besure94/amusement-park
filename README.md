## Amusement Park

#### By Brian Scherner

#### A website for an amusement park.

## Description

This website allows users to view an amusement park, which asks for their age, and height in inches. If a user is age 12 or older and at least 60 inches tall, they can ride all of the rides. If a user is age 12 or older or at least 48 inches tall, they can ride 2 of the 3 rides. If a user is age 6 or older, they can only ride 1 of the rides. If a user is under age 6, they cannot ride any of the rides.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

If a user is under age 6, but meets the height requirements for the other rides, then with the applications current functioning they are able to ride the rides, even though this is against park rules. I plan to fix this bug once I gain more understanding of if/else statements.
